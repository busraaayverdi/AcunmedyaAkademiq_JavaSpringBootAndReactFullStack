    //AbstractAndInterface.Abstract classes in Java are used to define a base class that cannot be instantiated.
    //They can have both abstract and concrete methods.

    //Interfaces in Java define a contract that implementing classes must follow.
    //All methods in an interface are abstract by default.

    //An abstract class defines the fundamental characteristics of a class
    //and can contain both abstract and concrete methods, but a class can inherit from
    //only one abstract class, whereas an interface only defines method signatures and allows a class
    //to implement multiple interfaces.
